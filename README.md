# proginth

My [programming.in.th](https://programming.in.th) submissions.

*exercise caution when browsing this repo as the code it contains can be classified as a dumb approach.*

## Utils

- `.\cm {filename without .extension}` to compile cpp code using g++ and put the binary in `bin` folder.
- `.\cmall` to compile all files in `src`.
- `.\ns {name} {extension/lang e.g. cc, rs}` to create new code file from template.

## Commit semantics

That probably doesn't exist for this repo. It will most likely be the matter of if and when I wanted to.
